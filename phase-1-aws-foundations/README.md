# Phase 1 – AWS Foundations

This phase lays the groundwork for building data engineering pipelines using AWS services. It covers the core building blocks required to securely access, store, and interact with AWS resources.

---

## Objectives

- Understand IAM for secure access control.
- Learn AWS S3 as the foundational storage layer.
- Use AWS Console efficiently for navigation and setup.
- Install and configure AWS CLI for terminal-based interaction.
- Automate AWS operations using Boto3 (Python SDK).

## Tools Covered

| Tool       | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [IAM](phase-1-aws-foundations/notes/iam.md)        | Manage users, groups, roles, and permissions securely.                      |
| [S3](phase-1-aws-foundations/notes/s3.md)         | Scalable object storage for raw, intermediate, and processed data.         |
| [AWS Console](phase-1-aws-foundations/notes/aws_console.md) | Web-based UI for interacting with all AWS services.                        |
| [AWS CLI](phase-1-aws-foundations/notes/aws_cli.md)    | Command-line interface for scripting and automation.                        |
| Boto3      | Python library to interact with AWS services programmatically.              |

## Structure

- `notes/` – Deep conceptual explanations of IAM, S3, Console, CLI, Boto3.
- `hands-on/` – Verified exercises and walkthroughs to practice each tool.
- `assets/` – Screenshots or scripts related to Phase 1.

---

## Outcomes

By the end of this phase, you will:
- Be able to create and manage IAM users securely.
- Upload, organize, and manage objects in S3.
- Use both AWS Console and CLI to interact with services.
- Write Python scripts using Boto3 for automation.

## Next

Once Phase 1 is complete, move to [Phase 2 – Ingestion Layer](../phase-2-ingestion/README.md).
