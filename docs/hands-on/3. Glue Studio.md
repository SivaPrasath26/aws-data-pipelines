## 3. Verify and Attach Required Permissions

Ensure the IAM role has permissions for Glue, source, and target resources.

If permissions are missing, add the following inline policy:

1. Navigate in AWS Console to:
   `IAM → Roles → AWSGlueServiceRole-Project`

2. Click **Add inline policy**

3. Switch to the **JSON** tab and paste:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "glue:*",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "cloudwatch:PutMetricData",
        "iam:PassRole"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

```

4. Review and save the policy

## 4. Configure Trust Relationship for the Glue Role
Glue must be allowed to assume the IAM role.

Go to the Trust relationships tab of the role.

Ensure the following policy is present to allow Glue service to assume the role:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "glue.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole
    }
}

```

## 5. Try opening notebook from AWS Glue Studio

If the notebook throws the below error

"Failed to authenticate user due to missing information in request."

There is a workaround for resolving this. Follow the below steps.
